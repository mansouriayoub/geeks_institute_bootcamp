# Submission Rules for the Bootcamp

👋 Dear Geeks, Please follow these rules to keep your work **organized, professional, and accepted.**

---

## 1️⃣ Repo Structure (MOST IMPORTANT)

All your work must be inside **one repository**.

Use folders for weeks and days, like this:

```
├── week_1/
│   ├── day_1/
│   │   ├── daily_challenges/
│   │   ├── exercises/
│   └── day_2/
│   │   ├── daily_challenges/
│   │   ├── exercises/
└── week_2/
    └── day_1/
        ├── daily_challenges/
        └── exercises/
```

⚠️ If this structure is not followed, your submission will be **rejected**.

---

## 2️⃣ Repository Rules

- ✅ Use **one repo** for all weeks and days of the bootcamp.
    - Suggested name: `geeks_institute_bootcamp`
- ✅ **Only create a new repo if the project is**:
    - Group project
    - Remote project
    - App with frontend + backend + database
- ❌ Don’t create a new repo for small exercises or daily challenges.

---

## 3️⃣ File Rules

- If exercises are **simple**:
    - ✅ Put them in **one file only** (example: `exercises.js`).
    - Separate each exercise with comments:
    
    ```jsx
    // Exercise 1
    console.log("Hello World");
    
    // Exercise 2
    const result = (99 **3) *8;
    console.log(result);
    ```
    
- If an exercise requires multiple files → Create a folder named after the exercise.

---

## 4️⃣ General Rules

- 🚫 Don’t mix everything in one folder.
- 🚫 Don’t use random file names (`test.js`, `mycode.js`).
- ✅ Always follow the given folder names.
- ✅ Keep your repo clean.

---

👉 Remember:

- Small work = stay in the **main repo**.
- Big project = make a **new repo** (only if really needed).
- 🚨 Messy repo = may be rejected.
