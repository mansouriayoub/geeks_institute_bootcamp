/**
 * Instructions

In this exercise, you will use object oriented programming concepts to define and use a custom object in JavaScript.
Create a class named Video. The class should be constructed with the following parameters:
title (a string)
uploader (a string, the person who uploaded it)
time (a number, the duration of the video - in seconds)

Create a method called watch() which displays a string as follows:
“uploader parameter watched all time parameter of title parameter!”
 */
class Video {
    constructor(title,uploader,time) {
        this.title = title;
        this.uploader = uploader;
        this.time = time;
    }
    watch(){
        console.log(`${this.uploader} watched all ${this.time} of ${this.title}!`);
    }
}

/**
 * Instantiate a new Video instance and call the watch() method.
 * Instantiate a second Video instance with different values.
*/
const vidInst = new Video('Dark', 'Net', 'half hour');
const vidInstTwo = new Video('White', 'Gol', 'Thirty minutes');

/**
 * Bonus: Use an array to store data for five Video instances (ie. title, uploader, time)
 * Think of the best data structure to save this information within the array.
 * Bonus: Loop through the array to instantiate those instances.
 */
const data = [
    {
        title: "First Video",
        uploader: "Alice",
        time: 120
    },
    {
        title: "Second Adventure",
        uploader: "Bob",
        time: 300
    },
    {
        title: "Cooking Fun",
        uploader: "Carol",
        time: 600
    },
    {
        title: "Travel Diaries",
        uploader: "David",
        time: 450
    },
    {
        title: "Game Highlights",
        uploader: "Eve",
        time: 200
    },
]
data.forEach(vid=>{
    let instance = new Video(vid.title,vid.uploader,vid.time);
    instance.watch();
});
